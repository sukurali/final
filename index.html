							<p>OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN IN THE GLOBAL
								FINANCIAL MARKETS FOR OVER 60 YEARS. IT HAS
								ALLOWED US TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN CONNECTIONS
								THAT VERY FEW EVER GET EXPOSED TO. BEING
								EXPOSED TO THOSE CONNECTIONS IS ONE THING,
								BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE THEM IS THE IMPORTANT
							PART.</p>
							
							<br />
							<p> 
								WE HAD A MASSIVE PROBLEMâ€¦ WE HAD HUNDREDSOF
								MILLIONS OF SHARES OF PENNY AND SUB PENNY
								STOCK THAT WE COULD NOT DEPOSIT INTO ANY
								MAJOR BROKERAGE FIRM. DUE TO COMPLIANCE
								RESTRICTIONS THIS HAS CREATED BILLIONS IN
								LOSSES. THIS HAS HALTED ANY POTENTIAL GROWTH
								FOR START-UPS. WE KNOW THAT MANY INVESTORS
								SHARE THAT SAME FRUSTRATION.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>  
								OUR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AS TRADERS LED
								US TO CREATE AN OFFSHORE SYSTEMTHAT NO ONE ELSE
								IN THE WORLD HAS YET TO ACCOMPLISH. OUR METHOD
								IS TO HAVE A THE PROPRIETARY STYLE OF DEPOSIT/
								TRADES DONE OFFSHORE. IT IS DONE ON A REGULAR
								BASIS AND THE PAYOUTS CONTINUE UNTIL ALL SHARES
								ARE LIQUIDATED, WITHOUT HURTING THE STOCK.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p> 
								WE HAVE SOLVED OUR PROBLEM AND COMPLETELY
								ENHANCED OUR BALANCE SHEETS. NOW WE ARE
								LOOKING TO EXPAND THIS METHOD AND HELP
								OTHERS. WE ARE SEEKING COMPANIES, INVESTORS
								AND THE RIGHT TEAM WHO CAN BRING FORWARD A
								PORTFOLIO OF TICKERS.
							</p>
							<p> 
								EVERY TRANSACTION WILL BE ANALYZED AND ALL
								TERMS S T R U C T U R E D I N D I V I D U A L LY. A N Y
								INTERMEDIARY, BROKER, INVESTOR WHO PLAYS A
								ROLE IN THE TRANSACTION WILL BE GENEROUSLY
								COMPENSATED.
